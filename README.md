# Vish Singh - Portfolio v3

This is my web development portfolio. It includes personal projects, client projects, projects I built when I attended an 18-month long bootcamp between August 2019 - March 2021 (I took time off to move from NY to CA in 2020) and WordPress websites that I built prior to learning how to code.

The top of the page cycles through three sections:

- Front-End Development
- Back-End Development
- About Me

Below that, buttons cycle through the following project categories:

- __Featured Projects__: An assortment of 6 projects from all of the categories below
- __HTML/CSS Websites__: Responsive sites built using only HTML & CSS
- __JavaScript Projects__: Projects that rely on JavaScript for functionality
- __React & Next.js Projects__: React.js or Next.js sites, including those built for clients
- __WordPress Websites__: WordPress websites, primarily blogs that I created
